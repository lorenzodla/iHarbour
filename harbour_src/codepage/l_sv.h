/* NOTE: Following collations contains extra characters
         compared to pure Swedish alphabet.
         Quoting Klas:
         "the philosophy behind the extended collation strings [...]
         was to allow *all* alphabetical characters provided by the
         [Windows ANSI] codepage, including those not normally used
         in Swedish words and names, to be sorted according to their
         alphabetical context rather than an arbitrary Asc() value
         - as suggested by the Swedish Language Council."
